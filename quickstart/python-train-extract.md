# Quickstart: Train a Form Recognizer model and extract form data by using the REST API with Python

In this quickstart, you'll use the Azure Form Recognizer REST API with Python to train and score forms to extract key-value pairs and tables.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you must have:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (if you want to run the sample locally).
- A set of at least five forms of the same type. You will use this data to train the model. Your forms can be of different file types but must be the same type of document. You can use a [sample data set](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090451) for this quickstart. Upload the training files to the root of a blob storage container in an Azure Storage account.

## Create a Form Recognizer resource

[!INCLUDE [create resource](../includes/createresource.md)]


## Train a Form Recognizer model

   First, you'll need a set of training data in an Azure Storage blob container. You should have a minimum of five filled-in forms (PDF documents and/or images) of the same type/structure as your main input data. 

To train a Form Recognizer model with the documents in your Azure blob container, call the **[Train Custom Model](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2-preview/operations/TrainCustomModelAsync)** API by running the following python code. Before you run the code, make these changes:

1. Replace `<SAS URL>` with the Azure Blob storage container's shared access signature (SAS) URL. To retrieve the SAS URL, open the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, right-click your container, and select **Get shared access signature**. Make sure the **Read** and **List** permissions are checked, and click **Create**. Then copy the value in the **URL** section. It should have the form: `https://<storage account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container name>?<SAS value>`.
1. Replace `<subscription key>` with the subscription key you copied from the previous step.
1. Replace `<endpoint>` with the endpoint URL for your Form Recognizer resource.
1. Replace `<Blob folder name>` with the path to the folder in blob storage where your forms are located. If your forms are at the root of your container, leave this string empty.

    ```python
    ########### Python Form Recognizer Labeled Async Train #############
    import json
    import time
    from requests import get, post
    
    # Endpoint URL
    endpoint = r"https://archie-fr.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
    post_url = endpoint + r"/formrecognizer/v2.0-preview/custom/models"
    source = r"<SAS URL>"
    prefix = "<Blob folder name>"
    includeSubFolders = False
    useLabelFile = False
    
    headers = {
        # Request headers
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<subsription key>',
    }
    
    body = 	{
        "source": source,
        "sourceFilter": {
            "prefix": prefix,
            "includeSubFolders": includeSubFolders
        },
        "useLabelFile": useLabelFile
    }
    
    try:
        resp = post(url = post_url, json = body, headers = headers)
        if resp.status_code != 201:
            print("POST model failed (%s):\n%s" % (resp.status_code, json.dumps(resp.json())))
            quit()
        print("POST model succeeded:\n%s" % resp.headers)
        get_url = resp.headers["location"]
    except Exception as e:
        print("POST model failed:\n%s" % str(e))
        quit() 
    ```
1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, *form-recognizer-train.py*.
1. Open a command prompt window.
1. At the prompt, use the `python` command to run the sample. For example, `python form-recognizer-train.py`.

## Ouput of Executing the above Pythong Code ie: form-recognizer-train.py is as follows 
POST model succeeded:
{
  'Content-Length': '0',
  'Location': 'https://archie-fr.cognitiveservices.azure.com/formrecognizer/v2.0-preview/custom/models/e16064cc-525e-49cf-ad08-9c594d792507',
  'x-envoy-upstream-service-time': '30',
  'apim-request-id': 'b812f718-b56b-4b14-bd8f-82d9b597e988',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload',
  'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff',
  'Date': 'Wed, 13 May 2020 16:27:48 GMT'
}

## Get training results

After you've started the train operation, you use the returned ID to get the status of the operation. Add the following code to the bottom of your Python script. This uses the ID value from the training call in a new API call. The training operation is asynchronous, so this script calls the API at regular intervals until the training status is completed. We recommend an interval of one second or more.

```python 
n_tries = 15
n_try = 0
wait_sec = 5
max_wait_sec = 60
while n_try < n_tries:
    try:
        resp = get(url = get_url, headers = headers)
        resp_json = resp.json()
        if resp.status_code != 200:
            print("GET model failed (%s):\n%s" % (resp.status_code, json.dumps(resp_json)))
            quit()
        model_status = resp_json["modelInfo"]["status"]
        if model_status == "ready":
            print("Training succeeded:\n%s" % json.dumps(resp_json))
            quit()
        if model_status == "invalid":
            print("Training failed. Model is invalid:\n%s" % json.dumps(resp_json))
            quit()
        # Training still running. Wait and retry.
        time.sleep(wait_sec)
        n_try += 1
        wait_sec = min(2*wait_sec, max_wait_sec)     
    except Exception as e:
        msg = "GET model failed:\n%s" % str(e)
        print(msg)
        quit()
print("Train operation did not complete within the allocated time.")
```

When the training process is completed, you'll receive a `201 (Success)` response with JSON content like the following:

```json

Training succeeded:
{
  "modelInfo": {
    "modelId": "e16064cc-525e-49cf-ad08-9c594d792507",

      },

        ],
        "status": "succeeded"
      },
      {
        "documentName": "Invoice_3.pdf",
        "pages": 1,
        "errors": [
          
        ],
        "status": "succeeded"
      },
      {
        "documentName": "Invoice_4.pdf",
        "pages": 1,
        "errors": [
          
        ],
        "status": "succeeded"
      },
      {
        "documentName": "Invoice_5.pdf",
        "pages": 1,
        "errors": [
          
        ],
        "status": "succeeded"
      }
    ],
    "errors": [
      
    ]
  }
}
 
 
  Copy the `"modelId"` value for use in the following steps.

[!INCLUDE [analyze forms](../includes/python-custom-analyze.md)]

When the process is completed, you'll receive a `200 (Success)` response with JSON content in the following format. The response has been shortened for simplicity. The main key/value pair associations and tables are in the `"pageResults"` node. If you also specified plain text extraction through the *includeTextDetails* URL parameter, then the `"readResults"` node will show the content and positions of all the text in the document.
